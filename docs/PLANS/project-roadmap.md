# BlackFriday Marketing App Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

Transform the lottery application into a production-ready, internationalized, themed application with proper feature organization, testing, and deployment workflow.

### What Has Been Accomplished

#### 1. **Project Setup & Cleanup** âœ…

- Cleaned up public/ folder (removed unused SVG files)
- Created new organized folder structure
- Set up proper directory hierarchy for features
- Standardized on pnpm for better performance. Temporarily using Yarn due to a pnpm issue causing installs to fail (packages not installing). Weâ€™ll revert to pnpm once resolved.

#### 2. **Internationalization (i18n) Setup** âœ…

- Installed and configured `react-i18next` package
- Created i18n configuration (`src/lib/i18n/config.ts`)
- Created comprehensive English messages (`src/lib/messages/en.json`)
- Created comprehensive French messages (`src/lib/messages/fr.json`)
- Created language switcher components (`LocaleSwitcher.tsx`, `LocaleSwitcherCompact.tsx`)
- Set up middleware for locale routing
- Updated Next.js config for i18n support
- **All home page sections now fully internationalized**

#### 3. **Theme System Implementation** âœ…

- Installed `next-themes` package
- Created theme provider (`src/lib/themes/theme-provider.tsx`)
- Created theme toggle component (`src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx`)
- Updated Tailwind config with CSS variables
- Created comprehensive global CSS with theme variables
- Added dark/light theme support with CSS custom properties
- **Both themes now provide equal user experience**

#### 4. **UI Components & Architecture** âœ…

- Installed shadcn/ui CLI and dependencies
- Added essential UI components: Button, Card, Input, Label, Select, Textarea, Table, Pagination, Badge, Avatar, Dropdown Menu, Sheet, Dialog, Form
- Configured components.json with proper aliases
- Updated Tailwind config for shadcn/ui compatibility
- Created reusable component architecture
- **All components properly organized and exported**

#### 5. **Performance Optimizations** âœ…

- Implemented performance monitoring utilities (`src/lib/utils/performance.ts`)
- Added Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Created debounce and throttle utilities
- Added intersection observer for lazy loading
- Implemented virtual scrolling utilities
- Added memory optimization tools
- Updated Next.js config with performance optimizations
- Added webpack optimizations and bundle splitting

#### 6. **Enhanced Configuration** âœ…

- Updated Tailwind config with new plugins (forms, typography, aspect-ratio)
- Enhanced Next.js config with security headers
- Added performance and SEO optimizations
- Implemented proper PWA configuration
- Added image optimization settings
- Updated ESLint configuration for modern flat config
