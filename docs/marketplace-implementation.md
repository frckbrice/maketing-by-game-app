## API Architecture

### Data Layer
- **Location**: `src/components/features/shops/api/`
- **Files**:
  - `data.ts` - Mock data for development
  - `queries.ts` - React Query hooks for data fetching
  - `mutations.ts` - React Query hooks for data mutations

### Query Implementation
```typescript
// Example: useTopShops hook with caching
export const useTopShops = (limit: number = 6) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['shops', 'top', limit],
    queryFn: async (): Promise<Shop[]> => {
      // Development: Uses mock data
      // Production: API call to /api/shops/top
    },
    staleTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
    gcTime: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  });
};
```

### Mutation Implementation
```typescript
// Example: useFollowShop with optimistic updates
export const useFollowShop = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async ({ shopId, action }) => {
      // API call or mock implementation
    },
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      // Invalidate related queries for real-time updates
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['shop', data.shopId] });
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['shops'] });
      toast.success(`Shop ${data.action}ed successfully!`);
    },
  });
};
```

## Caching Strategy

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Uses mock data with simulated API delays for realistic UX
- **Production**: Switches to actual API calls seamlessly
- **Environment Detection**: `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`

### Cache Configuration
- **Shops**: 5-10 minute stale time
- **Products**: 5-15 minute stale time based on feature
- **User Preferences**: Real-time updates with optimistic mutations

## Component Architecture

### Props Pattern
All marketplace components follow a consistent props pattern:
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  data: DataType[];
  onAction?: (id: string) => Promise<void> | void;
  loading?: boolean;
  userPreferences?: Set<string>;
  className?: string;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
1. **React.memo**: All components are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **useCallback**: Event handlers are memoized with proper dependencies
3. **Lazy Loading**: Components load data on-demand
4. **Background Sync**: Mutations update UI optimistically

## Social Features

### Follow System
- Users can follow shops to receive updates
- Real-time follower counts
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback

### Like System
- Product liking with immediate visual feedback
- Like counts contribute to recommendation algorithm
- Social proof displays (e.g., "234 people liked this")

### Share Functionality
- Native sharing API with clipboard fallback
- Deep linking to specific products
- Analytics tracking for share events

## Mobile-First Design

### Responsive Features
- Horizontal scrolling optimized for touch devices
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px)
- Optimized images with Next.js Image component
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens

### Performance Considerations
- Virtualized scrolling for long lists
- Image lazy loading with skeleton placeholders
- Debounced search inputs
- Efficient re-renders with proper memoization

## Error Handling

### Loading States
- Skeleton UI components during data fetching
- Progressive loading with staggered content appearance
- Graceful fallbacks for failed requests

### Error Boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Fallback to cached data when available

## Translation Support

### Internationalization
- Full support for English and French
- Key structure: `marketplace.featureName.actionName`
- Context-aware translations for better UX
- Pluralization support for dynamic content

### Example Keys
```json
{
  "marketplace": {
    "topShops": "Top Shops",
    "featuredProducts": "Featured Products", 
    "productsYouMightLike": "Products You Might Like",
    "personalizedRecommendations": "Curated just for you based on your preferences"
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Real-time chat with shop owners
2. Advanced filtering and sorting options
3. Wishlist functionality
4. Price tracking and alerts
5. Advanced recommendation algorithms

### Performance Improvements
1. Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
2. Add service worker for offline functionality
3. Implement background sync for mutations
4. Add Progressive Web App features

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering with different props
- Hook behavior with mock data
- Mutation success/failure scenarios

### Integration Tests
- API integration with proper error handling
- User interaction flows
- Performance benchmarks

### E2E Tests
- Complete user journeys
- Cross-device compatibility
- Accessibility compliance

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.lotteryapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
```

### Production Optimizations
- API rate limiting implementation
- CDN configuration for static assets
- Database query optimization
- Monitoring and logging setup

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the marketplace functionality while maintaining performance, accessibility, and user experience best practices.
