# 🚀 Lottery App Restructuring Plan

## 📋 Overview

Transform the lottery application into a production-ready, internationalized, themed application with proper feature organization, testing, and deployment workflow.

## 🎯 Goals

- [ ] Internationalization (i18n) with French/English support
- [ ] Dark/Light theme system
- [ ] Reusable component architecture
- [ ] Feature-based folder structure
- [ ] Server components for routing
- [ ] Google OAuth + Email/Phone authentication
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Vercel deployment workflow
- [ ] Version control with GitHub CLI

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### 1. Folder Structure

```
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js app router (server components only)
├── components/
│   ├── ui/               # Reusable UI components
│   ├── features/         # Feature-based components
│   │   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── dashboard/
│   │   ├── games/
│   │   ├── admin/
│   │   └── shared/
│   └── providers/        # Context providers
├── lib/
│   ├── i18n/            # Internationalization
│   ├── themes/           # Theme management
│   ├── firebase/         # Firebase configuration
│   └── utils/            # Utility functions
├── types/                # TypeScript types
└── tests/                # Test files
```

### 2. Component Organization

Each feature will have:

- `components/` - UI components
- `data/` - API functions and data fetching
- `functions/` - Business logic
- `index.ts` - Exports
- `types.ts` - Feature-specific types

### 3. Server Components

- All routing pages become server components
- Components imported from `src/components/features/index`
- Client-side interactivity in feature components

## 🔄 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Cleanup

- [ ] Clean up public/ folder
- [ ] Create new folder structure
- [ ] Set up internationalization
- [ ] Create theme system

### Phase 2: Component Restructuring

- [ ] Move existing components to feature folders
- [ ] Create reusable UI components
- [ ] Implement feature-based architecture
- [ ] Create index files for exports

### Phase 3: Authentication & Features

- [ ] Implement Google OAuth
- [ ] Add email/phone authentication
- [ ] Restructure authentication components
- [ ] Update routing to use server components

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality

- [ ] Create test files for important pages
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Write component tests
- [ ] Write integration tests

### Phase 5: Deployment & CI/CD

- [ ] Create Vercel deployment workflow
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure build process
- [ ] Test deployment

### Phase 6: Version Control

- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Set up GitHub CLI
- [ ] Create initial commit
- [ ] Set up branch protection
